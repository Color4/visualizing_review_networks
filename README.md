# visualizing_review_networks

Project for MSAN Data Visualization Class
Team: Kunal Kotian and Sooraj Subrahmannian

Here's an overview of the contents of this repo:

## Website
The website built using the contents of this repo can be accessed here:
https://smsubrahmannian.github.io/review_networks/

Supporting files related to the webpage are sotred inside the "webpage" directory.

## Code
The following 2 scripts are required for generating the 2 interactive visualizations:
* `restaurant_network.py`: Creates an interactive network visualization of restaurants.
* `topic_network.py`: Creates an interactive network visualization of review topics.

Note that hosting the apps on Heroku requires us to keep the .py scripts in the main repo directory, instead of inside a "code" directory.

Also, the "notebooks" directory includes .ipynb notebooks with some of our experiments with the data processing and visualizations.

## Data
 All data required to generate the visualizations is stored in the "data" directory.

## Slides
The slides we used to present this work for the Data Visualization class are located here:
