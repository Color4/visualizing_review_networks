# Visualization of Networks Based on Topic Models Using Restaurant Reviews

Project for MSAN Data Visualization Class
Team: Kunal Kotian and Sooraj Subrahmannian

Here's an overview of the contents of this repo:

## Website
The website built using the contents of this repo can be accessed here:
https://smsubrahmannian.github.io/review_networks/

An explanation of the features of our visualizations is provided at the webpage above, along with the visualizations themselves.

Supporting files related to the webpage are sotred inside the "webpage" directory.

## Video Tutorial on the Interactive Visualizations
A video explaining the background and motivation behind our project, as well as how to use our interactive visualizations can be found at this url:

## Code
The following 2 scripts are required for generating the 2 interactive visualizations:
* `restaurant_network.py`: Creates an interactive network visualization of restaurants.
* `topic_network.py`: Creates an interactive network visualization of review topics.

Note that hosting the apps on Heroku requires us to keep the .py scripts in the main repo directory, instead of inside a "code" directory.

Also, the "notebooks" directory includes .ipynb notebooks with some of our experiments with the data processing and visualizations.

## Data
 All data required to generate the visualizations is stored in the "data" directory.
 The original data source is the Yelp Challeenge (Link: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/json)
